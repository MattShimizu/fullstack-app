#Next Steps, TODO and FOllow up

The first set of additions to make to this would be error handling,
and logic outside the happy path in both the API and UI.

API-side would probably catch errors and bubble those up to the controller level to send the appropriate response code.
Things like, Id validation, entries null or not found, fields invalid or empty, all could be caught and logged appropriately.

In the UI, validation could happen on the textFields, ensuring that they have values before submitting,
and not allowing creation of a Communicaiton object with all empty fields. After updating the API to return more accurate response codes,
those could be used to inform the user more accurately of errors occured, or simply to log more detailed information.

Unit tests would be another next step, but there is not that much to test on these very lightwieght methods in the API.
Most would simply ensure validation mentioned above and that database operations happened successfully.
In each of the API methods, there is almost no branching or conditional logic to cover, outside of failure vs success.
